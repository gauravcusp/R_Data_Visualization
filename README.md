# R_Data_Visualization

This repository contains my coding assignments from Data Visualization class (DS-GA 3001.015) ay NYU Center for Data Science. The course was taught entirely in R and for the final project,I created a R Shiny based dashboard to identify rent burden across 10 different cities in US.
